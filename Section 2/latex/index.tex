\item Stores the exam scores in a two-\/dimensional array. The row subscript should be the student number and the column subscript should be the exam number.
\item Calculates the average score for each exam.
\item Uses the average score for each exam to calculate and display the students grade for that exam. If the student score is within plus or minus 5 points of the average, it gives a grade of C. If the grade is more than 5 points above or below the average, it gives a grade of B or D. If the grade is more than 15 points above or below the average, it gives a grade of A or F.
\item Writes each student name to the output file followed by the students score and grade on each exam in a well-\/formatted fashion.
